## Interactive Colourization and Animation
To create a more immersive experience, I partially colourized one of the black-and-white engravings using Photoshop. I then incorporated HTML and CSS animations, primarily through the use of the :hover pseudo-class and manipulation of the z-axis.

When users move their cursor over specific areas of the images, coloured versions of figures or accompanying text overlays appear—bringing new depth to the static artworks.

Emotional Soundscapes
To further enhance the atmosphere, I developed a music player integrated directly into the website. The selected pieces aim to reflect the emotional tone of each artwork, adding a layer of sensory engagement to the viewing experience.

## Accessibility and Design
The website is built with semantic HTML elements, improving both accessibility and searchability. The colour palette is vivid and high-contrast to ensure visibility for a wide range of users.

A fixed navigation menu appears at the top of every page. The menu contains animated buttons that respond to user actions by changing colour and size, making navigation intuitive and visually engaging.

## Technical Considerations
To ensure optimal performance and broad compatibility:
All images were resized and saved in PNG format instead of SVG, maintaining quality while supporting older browsers.

A universal typeface was chosen for consistency and reliability across platforms.
The layout employs flexbox, adaptive containers, and percentage-based dimensions to ensure excellent responsiveness on all screen sizes.

## Conclusion
This project combines classic art with modern web technologies to offer a dynamic reinterpretation of Dürer's engravings. By integrating visual interaction, sound, and responsive design, it invites users to explore historical works in a contemporary and accessible way.
