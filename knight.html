<section class="work_description"><h2>The Composition</h2>
    <p>Both of his two other Meisterstiche (Melencolia I and St. Jerome in His Study ) contain a skull-like object, a dog, and an hourglass, and all three are identical in size. The engraving is heavily indebted to the Gothic style.Many of the forms blend into each other. The outline of the horse is built from a series of interlocking curves, while the knight's chin is woven into the line of his helmet.</p> <p> These two central figures are surrounded by a tangled mass of branches, harness and hair, which according to art historian Raymond Stites contrast with the relatively solid figure of the knight and his horse to set them as a "tangible idea in a world of changing forms". The man is shown looking doggedly straight ahead; he does not allow his line of vision to be interrupted or distracted by the demons beside him.</p>
